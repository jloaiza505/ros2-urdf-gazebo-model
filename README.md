# ros2-urdf-gazebo-model
Physically consistent URDF robot model with validated inertial parameters and full Gazebo integration for dynamic simulation and joint behavior verification.

Problem Statement

Robotic development requires accurate physical modeling before hardware deployment, yet many implementations lack validated dynamic representations. This project focuses on constructing a physically consistent URDF model of a robotic system, including inertial parameters, joint limits, and collision geometries. The model is integrated into Gazebo for dynamic simulation. The objective is to validate kinematic consistency, joint behavior, and simulation stability under controlled inputs
